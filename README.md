Codes used in my master of science for clinical analysis

Research Background and Publication

This repository contains the data and scripts used in the analysis for my master's thesis, which also contributed to the research findings published in the paper titled “Human olfactory neural progenitor cells reveal differences in IL-6, IL-8, thrombospondin-1, and MCP-1 in major depression disorder and borderline personality disorder”. This study explores critical biomarkers in major depression disorder (MDD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD), highlighting the innovative use of human olfactory neural progenitor cells in psychiatric disorder research.

Master's Thesis
The scripts and clinical scale analyses detailed in this repository were pivotal in the data processing and analysis stages of my master’s thesis. This work laid the groundwork for the subsequent research publication, contributing to a deeper understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders.

Davalos-Guzman, A. P., Vegas-Rodríguez, F. J., Ramirez-Rodriguez, G. B., Flores-Ramos, M., Romero-Luevano, P. V., Gonzalez Olvera, J. J., & Saracco-Alvarez, R. A. (2024). Human olfactory neural progenitor cells reveal differences in IL-6, IL-8, thrombospondin-1, and MCP-1 in major depression disorder and borderline personality disorder. Frontiers in Psychiatry, Mood Disorders, 15. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1283406

The methodologies and findings from this research provide valuable insights into the molecular differences between MDD and BPD, contributing to the broader field of psychiatry and the pursuit of more effective treatments for these complex disorders.

Usage Overview

This repository is meticulously designed to streamline your analysis workflow. Each script within the repository is tailored to specific aspects of data handling and analysis, as outlined below:

Scripts Breakdown
data_preparation: Dedicated to the meticulous cleaning and preparation of clinical data, ensuring it's primed for in-depth analysis.
data_visualization: Crafted for generating compelling visualizations, this script aids in elucidating the underlying patterns and insights within your data.
statistical_analysis: The backbone for executing rigorous statistical tests, providing the foundation for your analytical conclusions.

Clinical Scales Analysis
Our collection of scripts is engineered to dissect and analyze a broad spectrum of clinical scales, catering to a diverse range of data types:

* 		Demographic: Targets the Demographic database, offering insights into population characteristics.
* 		Neuropsic: Delves into the Neuropsychological database, analyzing cognitive functions and deficits.
* 		HARS: Applies the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale to evaluate anxiety levels.
* 		HDRS: Utilizes the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for depression assessment.
* 		AMAI: Analyzes socioeconomic factors using the AMAI (Asociación Mexicana de Agencias de Investigación de Mercado y Opinión Pública) scale.
* 		ASIP: Evaluates the severity of addiction with the Addiction Severity Index patient rating scale.
* 		VAS: Measures the intensity of cocaine craving through the Visual Analogue Scale.
* 		CCQ-N: Assesses current craving using the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire Now.
* 		CCQ-G: Gauges general craving over the past week with the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire General.
* 		SCL-90: Offers a comprehensive overview of general psychiatric symptoms via the Symptom Checklist-90.
* 		BIS: Measures impulsivity through the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.
* 		MINI: Provides psychiatric diagnoses based on the DSM-IV with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview.
* 		Tobacco: Focuses on tobacco use and habits within the Tobacco use database.
